https://stockapp-h3z1.onrender.com (use POSTMAN)
### This project is a stock market api built with Node.js, Express and mongoDB. It allows users to retrieve information about stocks, track favorites, and view price history.


# Requirements and Features üìë

The Stock Market App comes with a set of requirements and features that enhance its functionality and usability. Before getting started, ensure that your environment meets the specified requirements.

## Requirements

- **Node.js:** The application is built on Node.js, and it requires Node.js version 12 or higher. You can download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

- **npm (Node Package Manager):** npm is the default package manager for Node.js. It is used to manage project dependencies. You can install npm along with Node.js.

## Features

### 1. User Authentication

- **Description:** User authentication is implemented to secure certain functionalities of the application. Users need to authenticate to access features like adding stocks to favorites.

### 2. Stock Data Retrieval

- **Description:** The application fetches real-time stock data, providing users with up-to-date information on top-performing stocks and their price history.

### 3. Favorites Management

- **Description:** Users can maintain a list of favorite stocks. They can add or remove stocks from their favorites, allowing for a personalized stock tracking experience.

### 4. Top 10 Stocks

- **Description:** The application offers an endpoint to retrieve information about the top 10 stocks. This feature enables users to quickly identify high-performing stocks.

### 5. Price History

- **Description:** Users can view the historical price data of a specific stock by accessing the price history endpoint. This feature aids in analyzing a stock's performance over time.

## Additional Notes

- **Middleware:** The application uses middleware for user authentication (`protectRoute` in `authController.js`). Ensure that the middleware is configured correctly for secure access to protected endpoints.

- **Port Configuration:** By default, the application runs on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You can customize the port by modifying the `app.listen` function in the `app.js` file.

Make sure to review the installation guide and endpoint documentation for a seamless setup and exploration of the Stock Market App.
